This repo started with creating a login page with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br/>
The current code consists has a backend server which connects to the database for authentication.<br/><br/>

I used [passport-local](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local) stratery for authentication and [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) database.<br/><br/>

There are two branches in the repo. 
- The main branch consists of simple authentication using mongodb and predefined credentials
- The passportJS branch consists of complete implementation of passportJS with mongoose database
